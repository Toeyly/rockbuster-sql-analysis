# Rockbuster Stealth SQL Analysis

## Project Overview
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company preparing to launch an online video rental service to compete with streaming platforms.  
In this project, I used SQL (PostgreSQL) to answer business questions for Rockbuster’s management team and support their 2020 strategy.

## Business Questions (Management Board)
- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Tools
- PostgreSQL
- SQL
- (Optional) Tableau / Excel for visualization and reporting

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data profiling & cleaning checks
- Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT), GROUP BY, HAVING
- JOINs across multiple tables
- Subqueries and/or CTEs
- Business-focused interpretation of results

## Repository Structure
- `/sql/` – selected SQL scripts (joins, subqueries/CTEs, analysis queries)
- `/outputs/` – exported result tables or screenshots (optional)
- `/docs/` – data dictionary / ERD notes (optional)

## Notes
Datasets are not included in this repository.
